// Algorithm
// We use Three Pointers to reverse a List.
// The Three Pointers are Previous, Current and Next.
// Initialize Current pointer to Head.
// Traverse till the end of the List.
// Initialize the Previous pointer be null since there is nothing before head.
// At Each index, We have to know the next node. for traversing forward.
// Use Next to store the curr.next
// Now to Reverse the list. The current pointerâ€™s next have to point the previous node.
// Now we have reversed the index. We have to repeat this step till the end of the list.
// We have to simply move one step ahead.
// For that, The current pointer becomes the previous pointer.
// The next pointer becomes the current.

//Tortoise & Hare Approach between 2 points in place

// Algorithm
// Traverse till the mth node. Make it Current Node.
// Make the m-1 node as a start node.
// The Start Node indicates the start of the k-nodes that you have to reverse.
// Then you have Reverse the List from m to n.
// Now you have to link the start node to the last node of the reversed node.
// Link the Last Node to the current nth node.
// Return the List.
